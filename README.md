# Live Class Monitoring System using Face-Emotion-Recognition  
Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions.

# Introduction
   Audiovisual emotion recognition is not a new problem. There has been a lot of work in visual pattern recognition for facial emotional expression recognition, as well as in signal processing for audio-based detection of emotions, and many multimodal approaches combining these cues. However, improvements in hardware, availability of datasets and wide-scale annotation infrastructure made it possible to create real affective systems a reality, and we now see applications across many domains, including robotics, HCI, healthcare, and multimedia.
