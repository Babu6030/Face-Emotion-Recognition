# Live Class Monitoring System using Face-Emotion-Recognition  
Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions.



# Introduction
   Audiovisual emotion recognition is not a new problem. There has been a lot of work in visual pattern recognition for facial emotional expression recognition, as well as in signal processing for audio-based detection of emotions, and many multimodal approaches combining these cues. However, improvements in hardware, availability of datasets and wide-scale annotation infrastructure made it possible to create real affective systems a reality, and we now see applications across many domains, including robotics, HCI, healthcare, and multimedia.
   
# Problem Statement
   The Indian education landscape has been undergoing rapid changes for the past 10 years owing to the advancement of web-based learning services, specifically, eLearning platforms.
Global E-learning is estimated to witness an 8X over the next 5 years to reach USD 2B in 2021. India is expected to grow with a CAGR of 44% crossing the 10M users mark in 2021. Although the market is growing on a rapid scale, there are major challenges associated with digital learning when compared with brick and mortar classrooms.
One of many challenges is how to ensure quality learning for students. Digital platforms might overpower physical classrooms in terms of content quality but when it comes to understanding whether students are able to grasp the content in a live class scenario is yet an open-end challenge.
In a physical classroom during a lecturing teacher can see the faces and assess the emotion of the class and tune their lecture accordingly, whether he is going fast or slow. He can identify students who need special attention.

   Digital classrooms are conducted via video telephony software program (ex-Zoom) where it’s not possible for medium scale class (25-50) to see all students and access the mood. Because of this drawback, students are not focusing on content due to lack of surveillance.
While digital platforms have limitations in terms of physical surveillance but it comes with the power of data and machines which can work for you. It provides data in the form of video, audio, and texts which can be analyzed using deep learning algorithms.
Deep learning backed system not only solves the surveillance issue, but it also removes the human bias from the system, and all information is no longer in the teacher’s brain rather translated in numbers that can be analyzed and tracked.
   
 we are going to slove this with help of sequential CNN model  by producing a solution to facial emotion recognition.
 
 ## Dataset Information
 
Deep learning model which detects the real time emotions of students through a webcam so that teachers can understand if students are able to grasp the topic according to students' expressions or emotions and then deploy the model. The model is trained on the Face expression recognition dataset dataset .
   This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

## Model Creation
# 1. Using CNN with the help of Keras
   Deep learning is a very significant subset of machine learning because of its high performance across various domains. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is a powerful image processing deep learning type often using in computer vision that comprises an image and video recognition along with a recommender system and natural language processing ( NLP).
CNN uses a multilayer system consists of the input layer, output layer, and a hidden layer that comprises multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers. We will discuss all layers in the next section of the article while explaining the building of CNN.

• CNN model gave us training gave the accuracy of 80% and test accuracy of 68%. It seems excellent. So, we saved using callbacks and Tested on local machine it was worked fine.

• Flaws is more time taking and few emotions are very rarely detects .Because less no. of  faces are given to train.

• Validation accuracy was improved by Hyper tuning.

# 2. Transfer Learning using MobileNet
We shall be using Mobilenet as it is lightweight in its architecture. It uses depthwise separable convolutions which basically means it performs a single convolution on each colour channel rather than combining all three and flattening it. This has the effect of filtering the input channels. Or as the authors of the paper explain clearly: “ For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1×1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise separable convolution splits this into two layers, a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size. ”

 I have trained the model with MobileNetV2 and got the accuracy of 74% , which was better than previous model.
